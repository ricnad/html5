	<h1>The new BMW X4</h1>
	<h4><<strong>That carbon fiber wing at the rear deserves some attention.</strong></h4>
	<p>AC Schnitzer has done a lot of things with BMWs, primarily making the Bavarian cars than what they already are. The German aftermarket genius has turned the already sporty X2 into a more capable athlete, even adding more aggressive cue onto an 8 Series Coupe. It even made the BMW i8 an exciting machine that's meant to police the road.

This time, the German tuner turned its sights to the X4. The second Sports Activity Coupe in line gets nasty upgrades inside and out, including more oomph to its power plant options.</p>
