	<h3> Ed Sheeran - I see fire </h3>
	<p>Oh, misty eye of the mountain below <br>
	Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls <br>
	And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke <br>
	Keep watching over Durin's son </p>
	<p>If this is to end in fire <br>
	Then we should all burn together <br>
	Watch the flames climb high into the night <br>
	Calling out for the rope, sent by and we will <br>
	Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey</p>
